This project is a food ordering system. That implements all three types of
design patterns

## How to run the app?

You can run the app in two modes. You can use the typescript ts-node runner or
the compiled JS code. To do that follow these steps:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/async69/design-pattern-example.git
$ cd design-pattern-example/
$ yarn // To install the packages
$ yarn start:dev // To start code by ts-node
OR
$ yarn build // To compile TS code
$ yarn start // To run compiled JS code
```
## Builder

You can see the builder implemented in the kitchen. All the recepies
featuring and making all the complementary pizzas

## Decorator

All the sauss added to the code is created here. All the external additions and
external features can be added easily just by updating the decorator.

## Observer

The best part of the system. It's the notification system that notifies the
customers when their food arrives
